    "description": "Welcome to our world!\n\nThis is a multi-user interactive textual adventure. All the content and activity is created by the connected players. This world was created as an entry for [PyWeek 27](http://pyweek.org/), where the theme of \"6\" was given for participants to work with. Our response is an interactive textual platform containing six different literary worlds which we'll collaboratively create, inhabit and explore together..!\n\nCurrently the six literary worlds are:\n\n* Jane Austen: Recreate Netherfield, go to a ball, affect regency period manners and etiquette.\n* Poetic Passions: Everything is a poem, haiku or rhymes, speak in riddles or chat in rhyming couplets.\n* Hardboiled Detectives: It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, with the sun not shining. The client asked, \"Well, will you take the case or not, bud?\"\n* J.R.R.Fantasy: Orcs! Elves! Wizards! Bleak locations! Ancient mystery! Quests! (And impenetrable prose.)\n* SciFi and Future Worlds: As the service droids efficiently cleaned up the remains of the ship's captain, I wondered how long it would take to make planet-fall on alien world of Zaonce.\n* Parry Hotter: Inspired by everyone's favourite boy wizard, but in such a way that Warner Brothers don't go after us for copyright infringement. :-)\n\nJust type the name of the exit to follow it on an adventure. Feeling bored? Why not build something?\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to use this platform, why not ask for \"help\"?",
